        <p>Embarking on the counselling journey can be significant, demonstrating your commitment to personal growth. Ensuring that you find the right therapist is important, so to help you take this step, I offer a free 30-minute consultation, as I believe that trust and genuine connection are the cornerstones of a meaningful therapeutic relationship. This is an opportunity for you to express your counselling goals, ask any questions, and see if we would like to work together.</p>

        <p>I offer flexible therapy options designed to fit into your schedule. Alongside face-to-face sessions, I provide online and telephone counselling, allowing you to access professional support from the comfort of your own space, at a time that works for you. I also offer walk-and-talk therapy for those who find movement and nature helpful in the therapeutic process.</p>

        <p>Sessions last for 50 minutes and are either long-term or short-term. My fees are £50 after the consultation. I also offer concessionary rates: please enquire.</p>

        <p> I am based in both Forest Row and Tunbridge Wells.</p>

        <p>I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP). I am fully insured, ICO registered, and DBS checked.</p>

        <p>These are just some of the challenges that can be effectively addressed through counselling:</p>

                “I've been having sessions with Deborah since January, our sessions have been a safe place to talk about whatever I need to talk about, a space to cry, be angry and openly speak. Deborah has given me tools to use moving forward and really changed my outlook on the future. Thank you for everything.”

            <div class="testimonial">
                “I started seeing Deborah with zero expectation and an open mind having never had any form of therapy before. I found the whole experience to be totally life changing. I've been able to be softer to myself with emotions that arise, giving myself time to sit with them. I've also managed to become more conscious and less compulsive with my reactions. Deborah is incredible at holding a safe space and guiding you through trauma to lift the heavy weight away. She made me feel so capable of getting through challenges and eliminating many limiting beliefs. I'm very grateful for Deborah's support and would recommend her to anybody who is struggling with holding onto traumatic experiences. Again, thank you so much for everything and I hope you’re well.”

                “I've been seeing Deborah weekly for ongoing counselling and have been welcomed with her genuine care and patience in a space that feels both safe and calm. Deborah has really helped me discover insightful ways to deal with my ongoing stresses and childhood trauma — often in a creative way. I am really grateful for how Deborah has helped me shift into a more conscious way of dealing with my life. Thank you!”

                “I have worked with Deborah Rea, as my Counsellor, for some time, following a catastrophic schism in my family.
                I looked at other Counsellors, within easy travel and eventually found Deborah, who happily also works online. My first interview with her was very easy, given my circumstances and compared with others I had interviewed. She was professional, approachable, very easy to talk to and - having been a chief executive for some 20 years - I liked and trusted her; and I made an early decision to contract with her.
        
                I have never regretted this decision.
        
                Deborah has not given me an easy ride. Her questions are carefully thought through, and she can think on her feet. It has forced me to face some unpleasant truths about my past relationship with members of my family.
                At the same time, Deborah has helped me to come to terms with events in my upbringing and past, enabling me to surface issues that I had not considered, and helping me to rebuild my life.
                As I consider tackling some of the issues, both mine and others, I am now much better equipped mentally to do so.
                I owe Deborah a great deal, and I strongly recommend her to anyone who needs counselling and coming to terms with the hard issues of life.”
